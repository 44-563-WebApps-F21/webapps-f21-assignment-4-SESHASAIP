                  <pre>                           SCENE

           _Lawn in front of the terrace at Hunstanton_.
  
  [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
  large yew tree_.]
  
  
  LADY CAROLINE.  I believe this is the first English country house you
  have stayed at, Miss Worsley?
  
  HESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.
  

  LADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?
  
  HESTER.  We have not many.
  
  LADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?
  
  HESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
  Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
  big as France and England put together.
  
  LADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
  my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?
  
  SIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.
  
  LADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
  charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
  damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
  little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
  mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
  distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
  Parliament, Mr. Kettle—
  
  SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.
  
  LADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
  name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
  man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.
  
  HESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.
  
  LADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
  yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
  invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord
  Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
  was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t
  believe she ran away more than once.
  
  HESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.
  
  LADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady
  Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to
  have taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is
  right in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,
  one never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not
  considered the thing.</pre>
</p>
<h6 class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>
<p class="speech">But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?  It must be
    the next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.</p>

<h6 class="name PONTEFRACT">SIR JOHN PONTEFRACT</h6>
<p class="speech">I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.</p>
<p class="stage-direction">[SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]</p>
<h6 class="name ALFRED">LORD ALFRED RUFFORD</h6><p class="speech">
    One must have some occupation nowadays.  If I hadn’t my
    debts I shouldn’t have anything to think about.  All the chaps I know are
    in debt.
</p>
<p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ LORD ALFRED.]</p>
<h6 class="name KELVIL">MR. KELVIL, M.P.</h6><p class="speech">I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has
    been an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very
    heavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don’t think they meet with
    adequate recognition.</p><p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]</p>
<h6 class="name ARCHDEACON">THE VEN. ARCHDEACON DAUBENY, D.D.</h6><p class="speech"></p>

<h6 class="name GERALDARBUTHNOT"> GERALDARBUTHNOT</h6><p class="speech">Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord
    Illingworth had made me such an offer.

</p>
<h6 class="name FRANCIS">FRANCIS, Footman</h6><p class="speech">Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Tell her ladyship we are coming in.</p>
<h6 class="name HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6><p class="speech"> Ah, yes!—the moral qualities in women—that is the
    important thing.  I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth
    doesn’t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.
    </p><p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]</p>
<h6 class="name GERALDARBUTHNOT">LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT</h6>
<p class="stage-direction">[LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite

    </p>
<h6 class="name ARCHDEACON">LADY STUTFIELD</h6><P class=speech>Quite, quite wonderful.</P>
<h6 class="name KELVIL">MRS. ALLONBY</h6><P class="speech">Don’t find yourself longing for a London dinner-party?

    HESTER.  I dislike London dinner-parties.</P>
<h6 class="name ALFRED">MISS HESTER WORSLEY</h6><P class="speech">I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the
    violin. </P>
<h6 class="name PONTEFRACT">ALICE, Maid</h6><P class="speech">Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad
    headache, and cannot see any one this morning. </P> 
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Exit_ R.C.]
    </P>
<h6 class="name HUNSTANTON">MRS. ARBUTHNOT</h6><P class="speech"> I am afraid I don’t.  I live so much out of the world,
    and see so few people.  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord
    Illingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.</P>
